### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<img width="500" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safinazbg/safinazbg/main/alone.png"/>

My name is Safi. I'm a researcher, UX designer, and web developer working at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and Responsible AI. I hold a PhD in Design, IT, and Communication from the University of Southern Denmark (2022), where I explored how tools, frameworks, and technologies shape coordination, collaboration, and productivity in software teams.

I currently work at the Center for Hybrid Intelligence at Aarhus University as a postdoc and development lead, designing and deploying AI-powered applications for education, research, and professional use.  

My focus is on human-AI collaboration, explainability, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that are intelligible, curatable, and customizable.    

I build full-stack applications using Vue.js, Node.js, TailwindCSS, HTML5/CSS3 and OpenAI APIs, with a strong emphasis on user-centered design and real-world deployment.    

I work with vector databases, custom GPT pipelines, and graph-based knowledge search to deliver tailored, context-aware LLM-based assistants for teaching and beyond.
